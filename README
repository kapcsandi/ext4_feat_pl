= test 1

the created program should be run in all type of browsers
technology for client side: extjs+ajax
technology for server side: mod_perl
technology for database:
postgresql
task 1
create database table with 20 fields. create a perl script which puts random 5000 rows in the database table.
task 2
create an extjs grid which shows the first 25 results of the database table and all the fields, one column for one field.
The grid must have pagination (first 25, before 25, next 25, last 25)
task3
create a button on the top of grid: excel report. if somebody clicks the excel report button the whole database table will
be exported in an excel file at server side, and automatically downloaded to client computer
the goal is the most effective and shortest code

= test 2
